#UOS2FS

Code for the article: Uncertainty-Aware Online Sparse Streaming Feature Selection.

Implemented in Python 3.7, Matlab 2020b

This folder contains:

-Analysis: calculated the classifier accuracy of result

-data:contains the example dataset.

-Feature_Selection_Uncertian: the program of UOS2FS Part2.

-LF_Model: the program of the UOS2FS Part1.

-Masked.py: to simulate datasets with missing values.

-uos2fs.py: performed UOS2FS to get the selected results for a given sparse dataset.



Note:

To execute this procedure successfully, add the folder 'Feature_Selection_Uncertain' and its subfolders to the path of MATLAB
