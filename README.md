Implemented in Python 3.7, Matlab 2020b

This folder contains:
-Analysis: calculated the classifier accuracy of result
-data:contains the example dataset.
-Feature_Selection_Uncertian: the program of UOS2FS Part2.
-LF_Model: the program of the UOS2FS Part1.
-Masked.py: to simulate datasets with missing values
-uos2fs.py: performed the UOS2FS to the given sparse dataset.

Note:
To execute this procedure successfully, add the folder 'Feature_Selection_Uncertain' and its subfolders to the path of MATLAB
